    "Great question! Gradient descent and finding critical points (e.g., by solving \\(\\nabla J(\\theta) = 0\\)) are both methods for optimizing a function, but they are used in different scenarios. Here's why gradient descent is often preferred over directly finding critical points:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Computational Complexity**\n",
    "   - **Critical Point Approach**: Solving \\(\\nabla J(\\theta) = 0\\) analytically requires inverting matrices or solving systems of equations. For large datasets or high-dimensional problems (e.g., when \\(X\\) is a large \\(n \\times d\\) matrix), this becomes computationally expensive or even infeasible.\n",
    "     - Example: In linear regression, solving \\(\\nabla J(\\theta) = 0\\) involves computing \\((X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y\\), which requires inverting \\(X^T X\\). This has a time complexity of \\(O(d^3)\\), where \\(d\\) is the number of features.\n",
    "   - **Gradient Descent**: Gradient descent avoids matrix inversion and instead iteratively updates \\(\\theta\\) using the gradient. Each iteration has a time complexity of \\(O(nd)\\), which is much more efficient for large \\(n\\) and \\(d\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Scalability**\n",
    "   - **Critical Point Approach**: Solving \\(\\nabla J(\\theta) = 0\\) directly doesn't scale well to very large datasets or high-dimensional problems because of the memory and computational requirements.\n",
    "   - **Gradient Descent**: Gradient descent is scalable because it processes data in small batches (mini-batch gradient descent) or even individual data points (stochastic gradient descent). This makes it suitable for large-scale machine learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Non-Analytical or Complex Functions**\n",
    "   - **Critical Point Approach**: Solving \\(\\nabla J(\\theta) = 0\\) analytically is only possible for simple, differentiable functions (e.g., linear regression, ridge regression). For complex models like neural networks, the loss function is highly non-linear, and there is no closed-form solution.\n",
    "   - **Gradient Descent**: Gradient descent works for any differentiable function, even if the function is highly complex or non-linear. It doesn't require a closed-form solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Non-Convex Functions**\n",
    "   - **Critical Point Approach**: Solving \\(\\nabla J(\\theta) = 0\\) only finds critical points, which could be local minima, local maxima, or saddle points. For non-convex functions (e.g., neural networks), this approach doesn't guarantee a global minimum.\n",
    "   - **Gradient Descent**: Gradient descent can navigate non-convex landscapes by iteratively moving toward lower values of the loss function. While it doesn't guarantee a global minimum either, techniques like momentum, learning rate scheduling, and random initialization help it find good solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Regularization**\n",
    "   - **Critical Point Approach**: When regularization (e.g., L1 or L2) is added to the loss function, the problem often becomes harder to solve analytically. For example, L1 regularization (lasso) introduces non-differentiability at \\(\\theta = 0\\), making it impossible to solve \\(\\nabla J(\\theta) = 0\\) directly.\n",
    "   - **Gradient Descent**: Gradient descent can handle regularized loss functions easily, even when they are non-differentiable at certain points (e.g., using subgradient methods for L1 regularization).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Online Learning**\n",
    "   - **Critical Point Approach**: Solving \\(\\nabla J(\\theta) = 0\\) requires access to the entire dataset at once, which is not feasible in online learning scenarios where data arrives in a stream.\n",
    "   - **Gradient Descent**: Gradient descent can be applied in online learning settings, where updates are made incrementally as new data arrives (e.g., stochastic gradient descent).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Numerical Stability**\n",
    "   - **Critical Point Approach**: Matrix inversion (e.g., in linear regression) can be numerically unstable, especially if \\(X^T X\\) is ill-conditioned or singular.\n",
    "   - **Gradient Descent**: Gradient descent avoids matrix inversion and is generally more numerically stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Critical Point Approach\n",
    "The critical point approach is useful when:\n",
    "- The problem is small-scale (few features and data points).\n",
    "- The loss function is simple and convex (e.g., linear regression without regularization).\n",
    "- An analytical solution exists and is computationally feasible.\n",
